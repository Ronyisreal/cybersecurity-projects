# Demo Talk-Track (5–8 minutes)

1. **Scope & Ethics (30s)** — isolated lab; safe profiles first.
2. **Architecture (30s)** — show diagram, assets, IPs.
3. **Discovery → Assessment (2m)** — Nmap → Nessus/OpenVAS → ZAP/Trivy.
4. **Prioritization (1m)** — CVSS + context; pick top 3 risks.
5. **Remediation (2m)** — show a concrete fix (e.g., secure headers + patch).
6. **Proof (1m)** — before/after chart; reduced Highs; residual risk.
7. **Close (30s)** — next steps (CI/CD Trivy, scheduled scans).

Have one CVE example prepared and explain why its risk was high *for this environment*.
