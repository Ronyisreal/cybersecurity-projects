## > About this Repository
This repository contains a collection of **cybersecurity projects** I’ve built to demonstrate my technical skills. 
Each project follows a repeatable process: **discover → assess → remediate → rescan → document**.

### [Vulnerability Scanning Home Lab](./vuln-lab/README.md)
**Goal:** Build a small, isolated lab to practice vulnerability discovery and remediation.  
**Tools:** Nmap, Nessus/OpenVAS, OWASP ZAP, Trivy, DVWA, Juice Shop  
**Highlights:**  
- Performed scans on intentionally vulnerable apps (DVWA & Juice Shop)  
- Captured **before/after results** showing dropped vulnerabilities after remediation  
- Documented scan reports and mitigation steps

### [Network Traffic Monitoring (Wireshark)](./network-traffic-monitoring/README.md)
**Goal:** Capture, analyze, and interpret network traffic to detect anomalies and attacks.  
**Tools:** Wireshark, Nmap, Curl, nslookup, browser traffic  
**Highlights:**  
- Baseline analysis of normal home traffic (protocol hierarchy, top talkers)  
- Detected **port scans** using TCP SYN flood patterns  
- Analyzed **DNS queries** including NXDOMAIN anomalies  
- Compared **HTTP vs HTTPS** (cleartext payload vs encrypted metadata)  
- Monitored large data transfers to simulate **data exfiltration**  
- Reported findings with screenshots and `.pcap` captures
  
*(More projects will be added soon — cloud security, SIEM, malware analysis, etc.)*
