## 📌 About this Repository
This repository contains a collection of **cybersecurity projects** I’ve built to demonstrate my technical skills for entry-level security roles.  
Each project follows a repeatable process: **discover → assess → remediate → rescan → document**.

## 🚀 Projects

- **[Vulnerability Scanning Home Lab](./vuln-lab/)**  
  <sub>Goal: Build a small, isolated lab to practice vulnerability discovery and remediation. Includes Nmap, Nessus/OpenVAS, OWASP ZAP, and Trivy scans with before/after results.</sub>

*(More projects will be added soon — cloud security, SIEM, malware analysis, etc.)*

## 📊 Skills Demonstrated
- Network discovery & port scanning (Nmap, NSE)
- Vulnerability scanning (Nessus / OpenVAS, Trivy)
- Web app security testing (OWASP ZAP, DVWA, Juice Shop)
- Risk assessment (CVSS scoring, prioritization)
